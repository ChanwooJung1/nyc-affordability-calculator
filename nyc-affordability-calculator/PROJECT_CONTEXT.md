# Project Context - Brooklyn Rental Affordability App

## What This Project Is

A web application to help young professionals and college students find affordable rentals in Brooklyn, NY. The app calculates a **"Vibrant Score"** for each rental based on three factors:

- **Affordability** (rental price vs. median)
- **Transit Score** (average transit time to key destinations via Google Distance Matrix API)
- **Social Score** (number of coffee shops & restaurants within 0.5 miles via Google Places API)

## Project Structure

Located in: `brooklyn-rentals/` subfolder

**Key Files:**
- `placesAPI.js` - Google Places API integration with error handling
- `transitAPI.js` - Google Distance Matrix API for transit score calculation
- `rentcastAPI.js` - RentCast API integration for real rent price data
- `dataHandler.js` - CSV reading/writing with PapaParse
- `scoreCalculator.js` - Affordability, transit, social, and Vibrant Score calculations
- `server.js` - Express web server with API endpoints
- `updateSocialScores.js` - Script to fetch social scores from Google Places API
- `updateTransitScores.js` - Script to fetch transit scores from Google Distance Matrix API

## What Was Built in Current Session (October 26, 2025)

1. **Integrated Flask Heatmap with Node.js Affordability Calculator**
   - Enhanced Flask landing page with compelling affordability messaging
   - Added API endpoint (`/api/rentals/<zip_code>`) to serve rental data by ZIP
   - Updated heatmap popup to show sample rental listings for ZIP codes 10001, 11201, 11203
   - Added "View Affordability Calculator" button that links to Node.js app with ZIP filter
   - Node.js app now reads `?zip=XXXXX` URL parameter and auto-filters results

2. **Updated Grocery Scores for ZIP 11201**
   - Ran `updateGroceryScores.js` for all 10 rentals in Brooklyn Heights (11201)
   - Scores range from 85-115 based on budget/regular/premium grocery store access
   - Successfully verified data saved to `rentals.csv`

3. **Data Files Created**
   - `10001 Rental Listings.csv` - 10 rentals in Chelsea/Garment District
   - `11201 Rental Listings.csv` - 10 rentals in Brooklyn Heights
   - `11203 Rental Listings.csv` - 8 rentals in East Flatbush
   - Total: 28 manually collected rental listings

4. **Integration Workflow**
   - User visits Flask heatmap at `http://localhost:5000`
   - Clicks on ZIP code ‚Üí sees sample rentals in popup
   - Clicks "View Affordability Calculator" ‚Üí opens `http://localhost:3000?zip=XXXXX`
   - Calculator automatically filters to that ZIP and shows full breakdown

## What Was Built in Previous Session (October 22, 2025)

1. **RentCast API Integration for Real Rent Prices**
   - Created `rentcastAPI.js` with RentCast API integration
   - Supports fetching rent estimates by address or coordinates
   - Includes market statistics (median rent) by ZIP code
   - Returns price ranges, property details, and square footage
   - Comprehensive error handling for API limits and failures

2. **Updated Data Handler for Rent Data**
   - Added `updateRentalRentData()` function to `dataHandler.js`
   - Supports new fields: RentCast Price, Price Range, Bathrooms, Square Feet, Property Type
   - Preserves backward compatibility with existing data

3. **Created Rent Price Update Script**
   - Built `updateRentPrices.js` to bulk-update all rentals
   - Fetches market statistics for each ZIP code
   - Updates individual rent estimates from RentCast API
   - Includes rate limiting (1 second delay between requests)
   - Supports single-rental updates for testing

4. **Enhanced Score Calculator**
   - Modified `scoreCalculator.js` to use RentCast prices when available
   - Falls back to original prices if RentCast data unavailable
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing affordability calculations

## What Was Built in Previous Session (October 17, 2025)

1. **Replaced Walk Score with Transit Score**
   - Created `transitAPI.js` using Google Distance Matrix API
   - Calculates average transit time to 3 key destinations (Manhattan Financial District, Downtown Brooklyn, Williamsburg)
   - Converts transit time to 0-100 score (15 min = 100, 90+ min = 0)

2. **Updated all components for Transit Score**
   - Modified `scoreCalculator.js` to use Transit Score instead of Walk Score
   - Updated `server.js` API endpoints (`transitWeight` parameter)
   - Refreshed `index.html` UI with üöá Transit Score slider and display
   - Created `updateTransitScores.js` script to bulk-update transit data

3. **Verified Google Places API integration**
   - Tested API connection successfully
   - Confirmed all 20 Brooklyn locations return 20 venues (hitting API max)
   - Added detailed logging to `updateSocialScores.js` for debugging
   - All social scores working correctly

## Previous Sessions

**October 1, 2025:**
1. Complete Google Places API (New) integration
2. CSV data handler with 20 Brooklyn rental samples
3. Score calculation system (affordability, social, vibrant)
4. Express web server with REST API
5. Interactive landing page with sliders for customizing priorities
6. Script to bulk-update social scores from Google Places API
7. Moved entire project from root to `brooklyn-rentals/` subfolder to separate from existing Python affordability project

## Parent Project

The parent folder (`affordability-heatmap/`) contains a separate **Python-based** NY State affordability analysis project with:
- Flask app (`app.py`)
- CSV data for healthcare, housing, property tax scores
- Analysis of all NY zip codes
- These files are unrelated to the Brooklyn rental app

## Important Technical Notes

### Windows PowerShell Issue
- PowerShell execution policy blocks npm on this system
- **Solution**: Use Command Prompt (cmd) instead of PowerShell for npm commands
- Or run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` as Administrator

### API Key Security
- API keys are stored in `.env` file (gitignored)
- Keys have been restricted to Places API (New), Distance Matrix API, and RentCast API
- **Never share API keys publicly or commit to Git**
- Note: New API keys may take 15-30 minutes to propagate
- RentCast free tier includes monthly API call limits - monitor usage at https://app.rentcast.io/

## TODO: Tasks to Complete

1. **Update Grocery Scores for Remaining ZIP Codes**
   - Run grocery score update for `10001 Rental Listings.csv` (10 rentals)
   - Run grocery score update for `11203 Rental Listings.csv` (8 rentals)
   - Note: Currently only ZIP 11201 has grocery scores populated

2. **Update Transit Scores for All Rentals**
   - Run `updateTransitScores.js` for all 28 rentals across all 3 ZIP codes
   - Currently all transit scores are 0
   - This will calculate commute times to key NYC destinations

3. **Consolidate Rental Data (Optional)**
   - The main `rentals.csv` currently only contains ZIP 11201 data
   - Individual ZIP files exist separately: `10001 Rental Listings.csv`, `11201 Rental Listings.csv`, `11203 Rental Listings.csv`
   - Consider consolidating all into `rentals.csv` for unified processing

## Next Steps to Run the App

1. **Install dependencies** (use cmd, not PowerShell):
   ```bash
   cd brooklyn-rentals
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up RentCast API key**:
