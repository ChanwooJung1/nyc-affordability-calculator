# NYC Affordability Calculator

**A comprehensive tool to calculate the true cost of living across New York City neighborhoods**

This production-ready application helps young professionals and students understand that **rent is only part of monthly housing costs**. True affordability includes transportation, daily living expenses, and grocery access - factors that can add or save hundreds of dollars per month.

## Why NYC Affordability Calculator?

**The Problem:** A $2,500 rental in a car-dependent neighborhood can cost MORE overall than a $3,000 rental with excellent subway access and nearby discount grocers.

**The Solution:** This calculator measures total cost of living using four affordability scores:

### The Four Pillars of Affordability (60/20/10/10)

1. **ðŸ’° Housing Affordability (60%)**
   - Compares rent to neighborhood median
   - Finding below-median rentals saves $200-500/month
   - Data: Manually collected from Zillow

2. **ðŸš‡ Transportation Affordability (20%)**
   - Measures subway access and commute times
   - Good transit eliminates car ownership: saves $400-800/month
   - Shorter commutes save 10-20 hours/month
   - Data: Google Distance Matrix API

3. **â˜• Daily Living Affordability (10%)**
   - Counts walkable restaurants and cafes within 0.5 miles
   - Eliminates car-dependent errands and delivery fees: saves $100-200/month
   - Data: Google Places API

4. **ðŸ›’ Grocery Affordability (10%)**
   - Measures access to discount vs. premium grocery stores
   - Budget stores (Trader Joe's, Aldi) vs premium (Whole Foods): saves $100-200/month
   - Data: Google Places API with store categorization

**Combined, these factors calculate an overall Affordability Index (0-100 scale) that reveals the true monthly cost of living in each neighborhood.**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Google Cloud account** with:
  - Places API (New) enabled
  - Distance Matrix API enabled
- **Google API keys** (see setup below)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up API keys:**

   Edit `.env` and verify your Google API keys are present:
   ```
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key_here
   GOOGLE_DISTANCE_MATRIX_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

   **How to get API keys:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable "Places API (New)" and "Distance Matrix API"
   - Create API keys in Credentials section
   - (Optional) Restrict keys for security

3. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Data Collection Workflow

### Step 1: Manual Zillow Data Entry

Add rental listings to `rentals.csv` with:
- Address, Zip Code, Rental Price
- Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Feet (optional)
- Latitude, Longitude (required for API calls)
- Initial scores set to 0

**Finding coordinates:**
- Use [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) or Google Maps
- Right-click location â†’ "What's here?"

### Step 2: Calculate Scores

Run scripts in order to enrich data with Google APIs:

```bash
# Calculate daily living scores (coffee shops, restaurants)
node updateDailyLivingScores.js

# Calculate grocery scores (categorized grocery stores)
node updateGroceryScores.js

# Calculate transit scores (commute times to key destinations)
node updateTransitScores.js
```

Each script:
- Queries Google APIs for each rental
- Updates `rentals.csv` with scores
- Includes delays to avoid rate limiting
- Takes 1-3 minutes for 20 rentals

### Step 3: Generate Zip Code Aggregates

```bash
# Calculate aggregate scores for heatmap
node calculateZipCodeScores.js
```

This creates `zipcode_scores.csv` with:
- Median rent per zip code
- Average transit/daily living/grocery scores
- Overall Affordability Index
- Used by the heatmap visualization

### Step 4: View Results

Restart the server and view your affordability-scored rentals at `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

### Housing Affordability Score (60%)
- Compares rental price to median for the area
- Formula: Linear scale where median = 50, half of median = 100, 1.5x median = 0
- Lower price relative to median = higher score

### Transportation Affordability Score (20%)
- Measures transit times to 3 key NYC destinations:
  - Manhattan Financial District (40.706, -74.009)
  - Midtown Manhattan (40.758, -73.986)
  - Downtown Brooklyn (40.694, -73.987)
- Uses Google Distance Matrix API with transit mode
- Shorter average commute = higher score
- Normalized to 0-100 scale

### Daily Living Affordability Score (10%)
- Counts coffee shops and restaurants within 0.5 miles (800m)
- Uses Google Places API with `cafe` and `restaurant` types
- More walkable venues = higher score
- Normalized to 0-100 scale across all rentals

### Grocery Affordability Score (10%)
- Counts grocery stores within 0.5 miles by category:
  - **Budget** (+10 pts): Trader Joe's, Aldi, Costco, Target, Stop & Shop, Key Food, C-Town
  - **Regular** (+5 pts): Food Bazaar, Associated, Met Fresh, ShopRite
  - **Premium** (-3 pts): Whole Foods, Dean & DeLuca, Gourmet Garage, Fairway
- Formula: `(budget Ã— 10) + (regular Ã— 5) - (premium Ã— 3)`
- Normalized to 0-100 scale

### Overall Affordability Index
```
Affordability Index = (Housing Ã— 60%) + (Transit Ã— 20%) + (Daily Living Ã— 10%) + (Grocery Ã— 10%)
```

Users can adjust these weights via sliders in the UI for personalized scoring.

## API Costs

### Google Places API (New)
- **Purpose:** Daily living + grocery scores
- **Pricing:** ~$17 per 1,000 requests
- **Calls per rental:** 2-3 calls
- **Monthly free tier:** $200 credit (~11,000+ calls)

### Google Distance Matrix API
- **Purpose:** Transit times
- **Pricing:** ~$5-10 per 1,000 requests
- **Calls per rental:** 3 calls (3 destinations)

## Grocery Store Categorization

### Budget Stores (+10 points each)
Trader Joe's, Aldi, Costco, Target, Stop & Shop, Key Food, C-Town

### Regular Stores (+5 points each)

## Troubleshooting

### API key errors
- Verify `.env` file exists with valid API keys
- Check APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Restart server after adding keys

### No results from API
- Verify latitude/longitude coordinates are correct
- Check RADIUS_METERS in `placesAPI.js` (default: 800m)
- Some areas may genuinely have few venues

### Scores are all zero
- Run the update scripts in order:
  1. `updateDailyLivingScores.js`
  2. `updateGroceryScores.js`
  3. `updateTransitScores.js`
- Check for API errors in console output

### Server won't start
- Ensure Node.js installed: `node --version`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Check port 3000 is available

**Key Insight:** Car ownership costs $9,000+/year ($750/month). Transit users spend 3-5% of budget on transportation vs. 15-20% for car owners. Walkable neighborhoods eliminate $100-200/month in delivery fees. A $3,000 rental with excellent transit and grocery access can cost LESS overall than a $2,500 rental that requires a car.

**This calculator reveals the neighborhoods where your total cost of living - not just rent - is truly affordable.**
