# Project Context - NYC Affordability Calculator

## What This Project Is

A **production-ready** web application that calculates the **true cost of living** across New York City using a two-tier system: an interactive heatmap showing all NYC zip codes, and detailed rental listings displayed in-app with comprehensive affordability scoring.

**THIS IS NOT A PROTOTYPE.** This is the full production version designed to help young professionals and students understand total living costs beyond just rent.

---

## Project Vision: Two-Tier System

### TIER 1: NYC Zip Code Heatmap (The Big Picture)
- Interactive heatmap showing **~180 NYC zip codes** across all 5 boroughs
- Color-coded by overall **Affordability Index** (green = most affordable, red = least affordable)
- Each zip code displays aggregate scores:
  - Median rent (calculated from manually collected listings)
  - Average transit affordability score
  - Average daily living affordability score
  - Average grocery affordability score
  - Overall Affordability Index
- Users click zip codes to see details and filter to that neighborhood
- **This is the main landing page**

### TIER 2: Individual Rental Listings (Displayed In-App)
- Shows **10 manually collected Zillow listings** per selected zip code
- Each listing displays **entirely within the app** (NO external Zillow links):
  - Full address (e.g., "123 Court St, Brooklyn, NY 11201")
  - Monthly rent price (prominent display)
  - Housing Affordability Score (60% weight)
  - Transportation Affordability Score (20% weight)
  - Daily Living Affordability Score (10% weight)
  - Grocery Affordability Score (10% weight)
  - Overall Affordability Index (highlighted)
  - Property details (bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft if available)
- Users can sort and filter rentals by any score
- Interactive sliders allow users to adjust weights (60/20/10/10 default) and see real-time recalculation

## Core Philosophy: Affordability, Not Lifestyle

**Everything in this app is tied directly to monthly cost savings**, not lifestyle preferences or "vibrancy."

### The Four Pillars of Affordability (60/20/10/10 weights)

1. **Housing Affordability (60%)**
   - Compares rent to neighborhood median
   - Finding below-median rentals saves $200-500/month
   - **Data source**: Manually collected Zillow listings

2. **Transportation Affordability (20%)**
   - Good subway access eliminates car ownership
   - Saves $400-800/month (car payments, insurance, gas, parking)
   - Saves 10-20 hours/month in commute time
   - **Data source**: Google Distance Matrix API (transit times to key destinations)

3. **Daily Living Affordability (10%)**
   - Walkable restaurants and cafes eliminate car-dependent errands
   - Reduces transportation costs and delivery fees ($5-15 per trip)
   - Dense neighborhoods mean no car ownership needed
   - **Data source**: Google Places API (coffee shops & restaurants within 0.5 miles)

4. **Grocery Affordability (10%)**
   - Access to discount stores (Trader Joe's, Aldi, Costco) vs premium stores (Whole Foods)
   - Can save $100-200/month on food costs
   - More stores enable price comparison and eliminate delivery fees
   - **Data source**: Google Places API (categorized grocery stores within 0.5 miles)

### Real-World Example
A $3,000 rental with excellent transit and grocery access can cost **LESS overall** than a $2,500 rental that requires car ownership.

- ~~`updateRentPrices.js`~~ - Deleted (manual data collection instead)

---

## Data Collection Strategy

### Manual Zillow Data Collection
**I (the user) will manually collect rental listings from Zillow:**
- Target: 10 listings per zip code
- Starting with: 5-10 priority NYC zip codes
- Scaling to: 50-100+ total listings across NYC
- Data collected per listing:
  - Full address
  - Monthly rent price
  - Bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft
  - Coordinates (latitude, longitude)

### API Enrichment
**After manual collection, scripts will calculate:**
- Transit scores (Google Distance Matrix API)
- Daily living scores (Google Places API - coffee shops, restaurants)
- Grocery scores (Google Places API - categorized grocery stores)
- Housing affordability (comparison to neighborhood median from collected data)

### Zip Code Aggregates
**Scripts will calculate for each zip code:**
- Median rent from collected listings
- Average transit score (sample multiple points or use centroid)
- Average daily living score
- Average grocery score
- Overall Affordability Index (60/20/10/10 formula)
- Save to `zipcode_scores.csv` for heatmap visualization

## Scoring System Details

### Affordability Index Formula
**Affordability Index** = (Housing Ã— 60%) + (Transit Ã— 20%) + (Daily Living Ã— 10%) + (Grocery Ã— 10%)

### Score Ranges (0-100 scale, higher = more affordable)
- **90-100**: Exceptional affordability
- **80-89**: Excellent affordability
- **70-79**: Very good affordability
- **60-69**: Good affordability
- **50-59**: Moderate affordability
- **40-49**: Fair affordability
- **30-39**: Below average affordability
- **20-29**: Poor affordability
- **0-19**: Very poor affordability

### Heatmap Color Coding
- **Dark Green**: 80-100 (Excellent affordability)
- **Green**: 60-80 (Good affordability)
- **Light Green**: 40-60 (Moderate affordability)
- **Yellow**: 20-40 (Fair affordability)
- **Red**: 0-20 (Poor affordability)

---

## Grocery Score Calculation (NEW)

### Store Categorization:
**Budget Stores (+10 points each):**
- Trader Joe's
- Aldi
- Costco
- Target
- Stop & Shop
- Key Food
- C-Town

**Regular Stores (+5 points each):**
- Food Bazaar
- Associated Supermarket
- Met Fresh
- ShopRite

**Premium Stores (-3 points each):**
- Whole Foods
- Dean & DeLuca
- Gourmet Garage
- Fairway Market

### Formula:
`Raw Score = (budget_count Ã— 10) + (regular_count Ã— 5) - (premium_count Ã— 3)`

Normalized to 0-100 scale based on NYC distribution.
